Good Morning!!!!!
===================================================================
Agenda : Gen AI testing - 
module #1  Prompt engineering 
modu1e #2  core python 
module #3  Gen AI and Agentic AI eco system 
module #4  A complete end to end project on Agentic AI .
===================================================================
Day #1 
1. We need to understand AI landscape 

Traditional AI  => Before chatGPT  => 
we do provide certain conditions or filters to automatically trigger an action needs to executed. 

=>After chatGPT => 
Prompt engineering => old one 
==================================================================
Gen AI => generating the new content based on your ask
==================================================================
 => generative AI  => a creative content needs to be created by AI brain. 

AI think like a painter and create a painting . 
AI think like a manual tester and create testcases => 
AI think like a automation tester and create a script to automate
Ai think like a developer and create few lines of code

it generating the new content with creativity .  this is what we can call it as Gen AI or generative AI.

AI brain => LLM ( Large language models) chatGPT/claude/perplexity/gemini  all these are LLMS. 
which can understand Natural language(human understandable language) and able to deliver the solution or answer in the natual language only. 

how you ask a question to the chat gpt in simple plain English and getting the answer in the same English. 

this task will be completed with the help of AI brain ( LLM)

 If you give more information as a AI brain understand your problem very clearly and able to deliver the response more accurately. 

refining the question to get accurate answer. as a tester until you get correct/accurate answer we have to refine the prompt. 

=> first as a tester you need to understand is your question 
a. is  correct?
b. is complete?
c. is having the style?
d. is this AI represents which role?
In Gen AI we do generate the code for ecommerce application. this content/code you can use for your ecommerce application development 
generating the code is AI brain responsibility , u have to use that code and you can execute.
===================================================================
Agentic AI =>  it will also similar to gen AI but more powerful.
It will take decisions based on the ask. 
===================================================================
Agntic AI will do action on behalf of you. 
an agent will work on your task and it will take an action automatically without your involvement or partial involvement is necessary . 

you can ask me what you want , I can plan , execute and delivery

I have capability of taking action to develop an ecommerce application.

you can ask I can develop and share an URL with minimal interaction of customer. 
https://lovable.dev/ is one example to develop an application with your ask / prompt.

Here the update is not only generating the code but also it will execute on behalf of you and provide you the output. 
===================================================================

2. We need to understand Positive testing , Negative testing 
happy path testing and non happy path testing 
=> what we can do with this AI application? => Positive testing
=> what we can no do with this AI application?=> Negative testing
=>what we frequently do with this AI application?=>Happy path testing
=> what we rarely do with this AI applications?=> non happy path testing 

Smoke testing => you can test you AI application is ready to test with all features or capabilities / strength or stability of AI application.

sanity testing => indepth testing on newly introduced facilities /features/modules/components
=> whats new in this version of AI 

retesting => Conduct testing once again on the new AI build to ensure previous issues which fixed in this build are delivering the accurate outcomes. 

Regression testing => try to identify side effects of the current fixes or changes in AI application. 

Traditional testing methodologies we are not changing and we use the same . The only change is instead of giving the inputs and testing the exact outcome in your present testing . 
but in the AI  we need to check the accuracy of the outcome rather than fixed outcome. 

this AI brain is trained well then answer is very very accurate . 
if it is not trained then answer is no response. 
if it is trained partially then answer is not accurate but answer a part of the real answer. 
%of the accuracy matters in the AI outcome 
=> same ask may result different responses based on the AI . 

example: if you ask the question to Chatgpt it will give answer 1 
if you ask same question o gemini it will give answer 2 
answer1 != answer 2 => but relevant answer we can observe in both AI brains . 
===================================================================
3. What is prompting ? an art of asking a question to the AI 
Art of asking a question is known as prompt 
how to ask that is prompt engineering.

4. Introduction to different prompt techniques. 
a. zero shot prompt  => only question you supplied 
b. few shot prompt  => along with the question we need to tell AI brain what kind of answer you are expecting by providing few examples 
c. chain of thoughts  => go in step by step 
d. contextual prompts  => keep reference of previous question and answer to your current question 
e. role based prompts 
f. style based prompts 
g. tricky prompts 
h. funny prompts 
=> Prompting techniques / how to trouble AI brain with your askings.
==================================================================
Prompt engineering is similar to your manual testing in the traditional testing .
An art of asking a question is only way to communicate with your AI brain. so as a tester you need to cover all possible scenarios to test this AI application
5. Few example prompts for reference 
==================================================================
Prompt engineering =>
what is prompting ?
why do we require prompting as a software tester?
types of prompts ?
